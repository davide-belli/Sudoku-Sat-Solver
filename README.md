# Introducing Sudoku Human Strategies into SAT Solver reasoning

- Human reasoning and SAT Solver reasoning are based on similar Logic fundamentals
- There exists a relation between Sudokus difficulties perceived by Humans and by SAT Solvers

### Hypothesis

- There is a direct relation between the increase in Sudoku difficulty and the SAT Solver performances
- The more constraints are added by introducing more strategies, the more our search space is reduced (combinations are better)

### Results

- quizzes rated as hardest by humans are also difficult for machines
- easier strategies greatly help in pruning the search tree for SAT Solvers
- combining techniques gives better results
